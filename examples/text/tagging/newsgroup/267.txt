  Hello,

  I have seen two common threads running through postings by  on the 
newsgroup, and I think that they can be used to explain each other.  
Unfortunately I don't have direct quotes handy...

1)  believe that when they die, they die forever.

2) A  who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death
   is unfair.

  I don't see what the problem is!  To ,  is, by definition, 
 death--exactly what  are expecting when they die.  There's no
reason  has to be especially awful--to most people,  death is bad
enough.
  Literal interpreters of the  will have a problem with this view, since
the  talks about the fires of  and such.  Personally, I don't think
that people in Hell will be thrust into flame any more than I expect to 
with a double-edged sword issuing from his mouth--I treat both these statements
as metaphorical.
