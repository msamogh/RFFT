Even if there was no independent proof that Luke's account was
valid, I find it strange that you would take the negation of it as

the .  Luke's account suggests otherwise, and in the
absence of direct eyewitnesses who can claim that Luke is mistaken,
then I suggest that this unequivocal assertion is suspect.

for believing in the .  Rather the issue is whether
those who witnessed it did.

I do agree that the posting you're responding to shows that there
